# Week 7 Mini Project: Rust Tool Packaging
## Eric Ortega Rodriguez
## Project Overview
This project involves packaging a tool using Rust. The tool should include a user guide for installation and usage. Additionally, the project includes setting up a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that produces the Rust binary as an artifact.

## Features
- Package a Rust tool.
- A user guide on how to install and use the tool.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that builds and packages the Rust binary.


### Building the Project
To build the Rust project, run:
