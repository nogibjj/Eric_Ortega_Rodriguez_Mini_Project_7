## Project Overview
Users can run the tool to multiply two predefined numbers (which can be customized in the code), and the output will display the result of the multiplication. In addition to showcasing the packaging of a Rust tool.

This project also includes a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline using GitHub Actions. 
- This automates the build process, tests the code, and produces the binary artifact for distribution.

## Features
- Package a Rust tool.
- A user guide on how to install and use the tool.
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that builds and packages the Rust binary.
